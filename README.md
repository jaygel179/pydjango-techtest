Project Information
-------------------

This is a Django example project (`imagedb`) that includes one Django 
app called `images`.

The `images` app uses two models, `Image` and `ImageLabel`.

* `Image` - refers to an image that you can upload/download.
* `ImageLabel` - refers to a label of an object inside the image.

An `Image` can have multiple `ImageLabel`s. An `ImageLabel` belongs to 
only one `Image`.

A basic Django admin page is available at http://localhost:8000/admin.
